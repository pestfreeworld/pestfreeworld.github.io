<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, similar to synthetic chemicals, and have a lot of the human and ecological safety risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Very impressed with the expert approach of Sunlight Pest Control group, my house was badly damaged by termite but they have done excellent task and they were extremely courteous.
