<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of insects, termites, and spiders have actually established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the type of a solid, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (lady finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a larger ecosystem and handles both with the big photo in mind.</p>
<p>16 For standard farms IPM can lower environmental and human exposure to hazardous chemicals, and potentially lower overall costs. IPM lowers dangers by decreasing total pesticide usage, using least dangerous pesticides when there is a demonstrated requirement, and taking special protective measures to reduce pesticide exposure living organisms and the environment.</p>
