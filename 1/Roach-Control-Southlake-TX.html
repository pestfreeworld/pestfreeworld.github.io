<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as an entire and thinks about a balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>When pest problems are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxic substances in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>When a practical microorganism remains in a cooperative relationship with a plant, it will actively protect the plant by hindering pests and damaging harmful germs and fungis. We understand how scary it can be to have even the slightest sign of a bed bug invasion These pests can cause skin inflammation and interrupt your every day life, and what's even worse is they spread out rapidly and are hard to eliminate. Don't fight a bed bug fight by yourself.</p>
