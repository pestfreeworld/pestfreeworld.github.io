<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as an entire and takes into account a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>We historically have offered nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of ecologically unsound approaches in addition to its array of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the probability that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control home insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly specifically about reducing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and determine them precisely, so that proper control choices can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. However, the major pattern has actually been toward using contemporary chemistry and molecular biology to replace traditional pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; however these ways are still rehabs.</p>
