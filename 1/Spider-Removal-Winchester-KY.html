<p>The new ribonucleic acid disturbance (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence specific genes in the target insect is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Certain biostimulants based on minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stress factors, however are applied as amendments with no claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These new products or technologies can fall into one or more abovementioned categories of pest management.</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived toxic metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, similar to synthetic chemicals, and possess a lot of the human and ecological security dangers as chemical pesticides.</p>
