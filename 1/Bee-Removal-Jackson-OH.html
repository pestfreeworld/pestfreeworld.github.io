Besides regular external spraying, whenever there was believed to be a danger of a pest problem developing, there was no documented or routine pest control program at MTSL at the time of the initial audit.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest efficient dose when other methods of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of techniques such as biological control, habitat control, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>National Pesticide Details Center: Supplies objective, science-based information about pesticides to enable individuals to make informed choices about pesticides usage. Mix pesticides according to identify guidelines. Waage (39) suggests that biopesticides could form the methadone of IPM," helping agroecosystems to recover from the routine of calendar spraying while we are revamping and supporting them to a more self-renewing capacity.</p>
