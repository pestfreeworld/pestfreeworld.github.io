With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a environmentally benign and cost-efficient  pest control technique ideally matched for both little and big farmers around the world. When termites have actually gotten in a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be deemed a decision-making procedure in which observations (from inspection and tracking) are used to make pest control choices based upon pre-determined management objectives.</p>
