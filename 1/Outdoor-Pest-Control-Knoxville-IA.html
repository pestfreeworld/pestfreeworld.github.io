<p>Issues with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or a minimum of consideration for its adoption at the national or local level in the majority of nations, and in many it has become main governmental policy.

Many insects have actually had their development cycles designed in terms of degree-days The degree days of an environment determines the optimal time for a particular insect outbreak. Bed bugs get their name because they are frequently found in beds, but can likewise be found in other locations where human beings invest a lot of time: couches, aircrafts, and hotels.</p>

Chemical controls were to be applied just after routine tracking showed that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control steps.</p>
