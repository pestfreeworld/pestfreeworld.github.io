<p>The determination of the appropriate cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in controling the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life stages.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, thus triggering colossal damage within just a few months. This stops the pest acquiring resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to client homes and companies to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes introducing natural opponents from a pest's native variety into a new location where native natural opponents do not provide control.</p>

Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
