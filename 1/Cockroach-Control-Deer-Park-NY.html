<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are chosen initially, consisting of highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Evaluation is often one of the most crucial steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of examining an IPM program and the results it has created.</p>
