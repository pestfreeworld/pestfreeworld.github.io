<p>The decision of the appropriate reason for pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest.

<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest problems, classical biological control technique is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

In a metaanalysis of information of 145 studies, the efficiency of either predators or parasitoids was shown to be good in minimizing the variety of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
