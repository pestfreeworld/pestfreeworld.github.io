Utilizing entomopathogenic germs, fungi, microsporidia, nematodes, or viruses, and fermentation by-products of some microorganisms against arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens typically come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>
