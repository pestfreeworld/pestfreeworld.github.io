The advantage of the misting pest control approach is that it's thought about to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are tough to be cleaned up. Cultural practices - depend on a strategy to make the crop or habitat unacceptable to pests by disrupting their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or area by both grownups and immatures.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ).
