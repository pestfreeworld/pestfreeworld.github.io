With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is considered as a affordable and environmentally benign pest control strategy preferably suited for both little and large farmers all over the world. When termites have actually gone into a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from inspection and monitoring) are used to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management goals.</p>

Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically specifically about minimizing pesticide usage.
