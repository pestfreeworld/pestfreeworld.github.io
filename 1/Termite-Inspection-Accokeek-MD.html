<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as a whole and considers a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>As discussed formerly, knowledge about the ecological correlations between insects and their environment is critical to efficient pest management. Recently, the European Union has adopted IPM as a policy for management of insect pests. If outsourced, the food business must understand it has an equivalent function to play in pest control" with the pest management expert, states Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your home uninviting to them. But family pests can also be a threat to your family. When trying to find a location to infest, pests choose to conceal in a location that provides food and a safe breeding place. Biological control is much easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (numerous crops).</p>
<p>It keeps the use of pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and environmentally warranted and reduces dangers to human health and the environment. In a metaanalysis of data of 145 studies, the effectiveness of either parasitoids or predators was demonstrated to be great in decreasing the variety of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
