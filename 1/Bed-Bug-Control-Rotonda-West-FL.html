<p>Organic food production is not pesticide-free and some of the pesticides used in an organic system are as harmful to humans and nontarget organisms as some chemical pesticides. Pest control experts can only do so much to safeguard the food supply," says Dr. Zia Siddiqi, Director of Quality Systems at Orkin The fact is, food business operators need to take an active function in integrated pest management by working carefully with the professionals.</p>
<p>We traditionally have actually sold nature short, both in its ability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of environmentally unsound methods along with its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thereby increasing the probability that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>The success of control strategies need to be determined using signs based on monitoring of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and effect on the environment. These include the renewal of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
