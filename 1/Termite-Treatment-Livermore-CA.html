<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your home uninviting to them. But household pests can likewise be a risk to your household. When searching for a location to infest, pests choose to hide in a location that offers food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is a lot easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (numerous crops).</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also based on semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are repelled or discouraged far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ).
