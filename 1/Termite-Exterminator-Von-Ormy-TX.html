Pest control is essential since insects and rodents bring illness, infest your kitchen areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your family pets. Use sign plants to identify the efficacy of pest management techniques and to monitor prone crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens lethal area virus (INSV) and tomato identified wilt infection (TSWV).</p>
