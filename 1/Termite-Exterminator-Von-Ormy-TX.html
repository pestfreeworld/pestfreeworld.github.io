<p>Biological control techniques can also be viewed as natural services as they do not count on making use of pesticides or other chemicals. Pest control is essential since insects and rodents bring illness, infest your kitchen areas and bed rooms, and bite you or your family pets. Use sign plants to identify the efficacy of pest management techniques and to monitor prone crops for the infections (tospoviruses) such as impatiens lethal area virus (INSV) and tomato identified wilt infection (TSWV).</p>
