<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) protects environment through removal of unnecessary pesticide applications. These professionals understand the effect of pesticides and ensure they utilize the appropriate ones (in the right amount) and use it in such a way that you and your family are exposed to little or no threat after the application. Since 2003, the majority of brand-new pesticide registrations have met criteria set by EPA for decreased risk" consisting of lower hazards to human health and non-target organisms, and decrease possible for contamination of groundwater, surface water, and other environmental resources.</p>
<p>These unknown or poorly comprehended potential risks argue for extra levels of protection including exposures to numerous pesticides, in your home, at school and in the diet plan; direct exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and personal care products; and the general difficulty in associating chronic illnesses to any one particular cause.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control family insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about minimizing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have actually been regularly using a lot of these IPM methods for years or perhaps generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in areas prone to pests, or using tolerant or resistant ranges. Sovereign Pest Control and its affiliated companies supply quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 house owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
