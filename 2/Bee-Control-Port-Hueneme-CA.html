<p>In Asia, different phases of IPM have been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>Sun drying: Kept grain pests can be easily controlled by sun drying. Pest control specialists or exterminators help remove unwanted guests from locals, business structures, and other public locations such as mice, rats, roaches, bees, spiders, ticks, bed bugs, fleas, termites, along with numerous other types of pests. Under IPM, actions are taken to control pests just when their numbers are most likely to exceed appropriate levels.</p>
<p>Many more recent pesticides are derived from plants or naturally occurring substances (e.g.-- nicotine, insect and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active part might be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability. A lot of researchers agree that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>Granulated insecticides are outstanding for dealing with pests, such as ants and any other pests that build nests in hard-to-reach locations or actively scavenge for food.
