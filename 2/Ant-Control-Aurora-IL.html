<p>A particular pest can be managed by particular alternatives, however they may not all be available in a particular location, for a specific crop, or within the available financial ways. IPM involves utilizing the very best combination of cultural, biological and chemical measures for specific situations, including plant biotechnology as appropriate. This preparation consists of attention to field histories to anticipate what the pest issues may be, selecting crop varieties which are tolerant or resistant to pest damage, selecting tillage systems that will suppress expected pest damage while giving the crop the best yield potential.</p>

Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, bees and flies are frequently discovered pests in our society.</p>
<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, efficient against drawing pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, effective versus red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixes, combinations of extracts from various plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, etc</p>
<p>Store pesticides in their original containers.
