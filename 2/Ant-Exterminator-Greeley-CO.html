<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecosystem approach to crop production and defense that integrates different management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and lessen the use of pesticides. By finishing and utilising an IPM plan, members might have the ability to save cash on pest control approaches which were previously used and can possibly minimize future issues with pesticide resistance on farm.
