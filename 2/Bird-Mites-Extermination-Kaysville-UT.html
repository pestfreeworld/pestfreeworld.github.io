<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community approach to crop production and defense that combines different management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides. By completing and utilising an IPM plan, members might have the ability to save money on pest control methods which were formerly used and can potentially reduce future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Since they are generally more reliable and can usually be used to control a number of pests, the majority of insecticides fall into the chemical classification. Physical barriers such as fences, nets, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and minimize the damage they cause.</p>
