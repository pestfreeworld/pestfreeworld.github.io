<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecosystem method to crop production and protection that integrates various management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and lessen the use of pesticides. By completing and utilising an IPM plan, members may be able to conserve money on pest control techniques which were formerly used and can potentially minimize future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Because they are usually more effective and can generally be used to control several pests, the majority of insecticides fall into the chemical classification. Physical barriers such as fences, webs, mulch, and tree trunk guards can omit pests and decrease the damage they inflict.</p>
<p>Pest Management fact sheets Data on arthropod pest abundance, location within the greenhouse, and population trends (boosts, reduces, or stable) aid determine the effectiveness of pest management techniques. IPM approaches include the introduction of predators and particular parasitoids (species of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects). The generic term pesticides" can use to a large spectrum of chemicals, consisting of insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.</p>

<p>As part of the Sustainable Use Directive on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are required to think about the concepts of IPM before using chemicals. Biological pest control is a method of managing pests such as insects and termites by utilizing other organisms 8 It depends on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural systems, however normally also involves an active human management function.</p>
<p>The professional user needs to keep using pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are necessary, e.g. by reduced dosages, minimized application frequency or partial applications, considering that the level of risk in vegetation is appropriate and they do not increase the threat for development of resistance in populations of harmful organisms.</p>

Specification of plagued areas and separated application of plant security items lessen the damage for humans and nature as chemicals are used only when it is actually necessary.</p>
