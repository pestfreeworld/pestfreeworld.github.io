A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally occurring materials.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly accomplish levels at which damage is caused therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a rich neighborhood likely will have a great deal of large, expensive houses, so pest control costs might be higher there because there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those homes.</p>
