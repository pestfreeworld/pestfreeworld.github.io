Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are urged and artificial pesticides ought to only be used as a last resort or just utilized as needed and typically just at specific times in a pests life process.</p>
<p>There are lots of agricultural practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the concept of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to consist of all tactics. This chapter talks about different methods to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or to put it simply integrated pest management (IPM).
