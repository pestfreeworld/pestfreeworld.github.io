<p>During several outreach conferences and field tours arranged exclusively for the public in Southern California throughout the previous few years, it was evident that a bulk was not aware of farming systems, had misunderstanding about sustainable agriculture, and thought that organic food is pesticide-free (Dara individual observations and unpublished survey information).</p>

Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
