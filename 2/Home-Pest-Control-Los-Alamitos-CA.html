The chemical controls are applied only after routine monitoring shows that a pest population had actually reached an economic threshold level. Many private product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in minimal locations.</p>
