<p>Releases of natural enemies might be required throughout the growing season in order to sustain arthropod pests at low populations. Reducing making use of pesticides is likewise crucial as an increasing variety of pests are developing resistance to chemical pest control. Non target species like natural opponents of insect get impacted.
