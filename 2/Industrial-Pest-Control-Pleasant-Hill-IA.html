It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides may be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these limits adjust for modifications in market prices, phase of crop growth, cost of pesticides, and so on, however in truth most are based on fixed infestation or damage levels.</p>
