	<meta name="description" content="Rodent Pest Control  in Linwood NJ - When properly implemented, a pest-management strategy enriches ecosystem services and provides a sustainable food source for a range of beneficial insects ( Hillocks and Cooper, 2012 ). Healthy rice agro-ecosystems support a diverse insect community by maintaining a complex food web ( Redfern et al., 2015 ). The insects participating in this food web can help maintain ecosystem function as long as predator species (insects and others) continue to flourish ( Allara et al., 2012 ). Two hundred and sixty-six insect species have been documented in rice agro-ecosystems (DAE, 2011).">
