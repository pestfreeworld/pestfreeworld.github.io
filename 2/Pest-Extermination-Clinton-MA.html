<p>Tracking and recognition lowers the threats of using the wrong type of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other methods will be more efficient. The advantage of the fogging pest control approach is that it's thought about to be eco-friendly, it's odor free and doesn't leave any residues that are challenging to be cleaned up.
