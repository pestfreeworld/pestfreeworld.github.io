Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to describe an organized technique of managing pests utilizing non-chemical pest management techniques and the sensible use of pesticides when pest populations exceed appropriate levels.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was thus synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular tracking suggested that a pest population had actually reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control measures.</p>
