Biological control - suggests a normal method of destroying pests as it takes place in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps prevent the requirement to deal with comprehensive populations that may cause crop damage. Safety problems and environmental disturbances continue to take place (Wright, 1996 ), and there are renewed appeals for reliable, safe, and financially appropriate options (Benbrook, 1996 ).
