In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have failed.

<p>You only have to invest an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by global concerns: the vicious cycle that develops from using big quantities of synthetic fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn triggers resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most important element of artificial fertilizer, phosphate, will virtually have actually gone out.</p>

With IPM, you act to keep pests from ending up being an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Recent missions for reliable, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted mostly toward advancement of new and much better products with which to replace standard toxic pesticides.</p>
