<p>An extensive knowledge of general IPM concepts and numerous management options for all possible pest problems is essential as some are preventive and others are curative.

If they can not enter it, pests can not endure without food and will not infest a building. Another approach involves utilizing baits that either damage the pests or avoid them from recreating.
