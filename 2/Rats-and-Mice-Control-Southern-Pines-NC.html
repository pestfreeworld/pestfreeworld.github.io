<p>In Asia, various stages of IPM have been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived harmful metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are considered as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical molecules, similar to synthetic chemicals, and have a number of the ecological and human security risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Many more recent pesticides are derived from plants or naturally taking place substances (e.g.-- nicotine, pyrethrum and pest juvenile hormonal agent analogues), but the toxophore or active part may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. A lot of researchers concur that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>This approach of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in recent years given that fire eliminates advantageous insects along with the pests and can have a negative effect on the soil. To decrease potential harm to useful insects, limit your spraying to little areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
