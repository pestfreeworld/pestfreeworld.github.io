The use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are artificial and urged pesticides should just be utilized as a last option or just utilized as required and frequently only at particular times in a pests life cycle.</p>

<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest problems, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has been effectively used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that suitable control decisions can be made in combination with action limits. However, the significant trend has been toward using modern chemistry and molecular biology to change traditional pesticides with less harmful chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; but these means are still therapeutics.</p>
