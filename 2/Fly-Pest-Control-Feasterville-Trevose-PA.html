<h3>Insect Prevention Feasterville Trevose PA 19053</h3>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as an entire and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and prevent pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Pests controlled: Use horticultural oils to combat aphids, mites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals ought to be utilized just as a last option, after mechanical, cultural, and biological approaches have actually been attempted and shown ineffective. Numerous pest control chemicals are toxic and could be harmful, if not used properly.</p>
