Really satisfying solutions to pest problems will need a shift to understanding and promoting naturally happening biological agents and other inherent strengths as components of overall farming environments and creating our cropping systems so that these natural forces keep the pests within acceptable bounds.</p>
<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound methods as well as its array of inherent strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the possibility that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
