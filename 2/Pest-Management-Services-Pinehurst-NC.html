The chemical controls are applied just after regular monitoring indicates that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Numerous private commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in minimal areas.</p>

In addition to the research study and outreach foundation and the four parts of management, factors that affect rewarding, safe, and inexpensive food production at a larger scale and their ramifications for global food security must also be included in an IPM design.</p>
