The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though disputed by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the surge of pest control.</p>
<p>Because of their possible damage to pest control workers, clients, and the environment, restricted-use pesticides are greatly regulated by Federal law.
