<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and takes into account a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>A specific pest can be managed by particular options, but they may not all be available in a specific place, for a particular crop, or within the offered monetary methods. IPM includes utilizing the best mix of cultural, biological and chemical steps for particular scenarios, including plant biotechnology as appropriate. This planning consists of attention to field histories to anticipate what the pest issues might be, selecting crop varieties which are tolerant or resistant to pest damage, choosing tillage systems that will suppress expected pest damage while giving the crop the greatest yield potential.</p>
